## Goal
This project aim at making an exploratory data analysis on Total Personâ€™s
Income (PINCP) based on the ACS PUMS 2015-2019 datasets. After variable selection and data cleaning for missing values,an annual dataset contains 70 variables and units with size range between 2300000 and 2600000. 

With these data, line charts are drawn to reflect the time trend of median personal income as well as its variance, and heat maps are used to show the regional imbalance of personal income in each states intuitively. 

Besides, regression trees are established to help find out the factors with important impact on PINCP, so that we can draw the characters of people with different levels of personal income, which implies the considerable income gap among all groups of people.

## Data
The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains data samples of actual
response to the annual American Community Survey (ACS) run by United States Census Bureau, covering approximately 1% of the population of residents in United States. The annual dataset has two parts of records, household-level and person-level, of which we are going to focus on 2015-2019 person-level records. 

These datasets cover the most common fields of daily-life of nearly 1% of
American people, which can help us to find out the potential factors affecting personal income. With these factors, we are able to prove the existence of income gap and track its source.
